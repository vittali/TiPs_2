I have a microcontroller and I want to upload sensor data
to the internet. I also want a database to store sensor readings and a nice gui so that others can use it.
Setting up my own server and maintaining it is not worth the effort. So I want
a cloud service, more precisely a _free_ cloud service.

This memo is a write-up of one way to set up the required software infrastructure.
I will describe hardware components like sensors in another memo.
