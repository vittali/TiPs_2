== Create the _My-Node-RED-App_ and the associated infrastructure

Create three items:

. the application itself,
. the database used to store sensor data.
. the build and deploy delivery toolchain

NOTE: there are several Node-RED-Bluemix tutorials on the internet where the database also stores the Node-Red flow files.
This is suitable for a work flow where development is done remotely.
However, I prefer a work flow where all development is done
locally and the flow files are then pushed to repository from where they are deployed automatically.

=== Create the application and the database
. create a <<Bac>> if not already done.
. from the Bluemix Dashboard page, click on the _Catalog_ menu.
. from the Starter Kits Category, click on _Node-Red Starter_
. enter the App name: _My-Node-RED-App_
. selected Plan: _Lite_
. select the _Cloudant_ service to be connected to the app:

This opens the _Getting started_ pane of the application's dashboard:

.The _My-Node-RED-App_ Dashboard

Ready to activate Toolchain support.

=== Create the continuous delivery toolchain

. Click _Overview_
. on the bottom right _Continuous delivery_ click on _Enable_.
. in the _Repository Type_ drop down menu, select _New_.
. enter the <<Bac>>
. click on _Create_

This is the dashboard of the Continuous Delivery Toolchain:

Get access to this repository:

. click on the Git tile.
. set up the git access code using a public SSH key: `top right corner icon -> Settings -> SSH Keys`
. copy the link to the repository and clone it:

[listing]
$ git clone git@eu-gb.git.cloud.ibm.com:<your name>/My-Node-RED-App.git

NOTE: the directory _My-Node-RED-App_ into which I cloned the repository is called the *project directory*.


Go back to the application's dashboard, then click on `Runtime -> Environment variables
-> VCAP_SERVICES -> Export` to export this environment variable to
a file named `My-Node-RED-App_vcap.json` into the project directory.

This file now contains all the Bluemix specific data needed to run the app locally.
