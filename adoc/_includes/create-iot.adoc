== Create the My-IoT-Platform service

I like the following video tutorials prepared by IBM:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLMX9gyTEr4[An Introduction to the IBM Cloud - Part 1 - YouTube]
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OysQX0VwZEY[An Introduction to the IBM Cloud - Part 2 - YouTube]

and the following documents:

* https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/IoT?topic=iot-platform-getting-started[IoT Getting started tutorial]
* https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/IoT?topic=iot-platform-connect_devices_apps_gw[Connection information for applications, devices, and gateways]
* https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/devices/device_dev_index.html[Device development]
* https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/reference/guardian/security_policies.html#set_up_policies.html[Configuring security policies]

On the Bluemix Dashboard, click on `Catalog -> Internet of Things -> Internet of Things Platform`
to create an instance of the IoT Platform service. Choose _My-IoT-Platform_ as name.
 Once the instance has been created, I get another dashboard:

=== Generate the IOT Platform access code:

. click on the _Launch_ button.
. on the IoT Platform Dashboard click on _Apps_, and on the top right corner click on _Generate Api Key_.
. leave the defaults and click _Generate Key_.
. copy the API Key and the Authentification Token right now because you won't be able to see the again.

NOTE: Remember: I refer to this pair of strings (API Key,Authentification Token)
as the _IoT Platform_ access code, see <<table1>>.
I need it later to modify the Node-RED flow application template file.
This allows me to access the remote Cloudant database when developing the app locally.

=== Configure connection security

To simplify testing, I change the default setting for connection security:

. in the IoT Dashboard, click on `Security -> Connection Security` and edit the _Default Rule_.
. in the _Default_ drop down menu, select _TLS Optional_.

Note that this is not recommended for a production environment.
The reason for this change is that the `mqtt` node.js module I use as test mqtt client
doesn't seem to use ssl out of the box and I wanted to keep things as simple as possible.

See also https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/reference/guardian/security_policies.html#set_up_policies.html[Configuring security policies].

=== Configure Devices

Device type creation and device creation is explained in the tutorial material mentioned at the beginning of this chapter
and therefore the following tasks are simple:

. create a new DeviceType with name _nodejs-client_
. and a device of this type with name _nodejs-client-1_
. click until your are asked to provide a Device Authentication Token.

[[dat, DAT access code]]
NOTE: I refer to this token as _DAT_ access code, see <<table1>>. I need it later to
instantiate the mqtt client test program template.

WARNING: write down the access code, it can't be retrieved once the page is closed.

The dashboard should now look like this:

Ready to add and modify the application project files.
