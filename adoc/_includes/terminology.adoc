== Terminology
As far as this memo is concerned, Bluemix offers _Cloud Foundry Services_, _Services_ and allows to develop
_Cloud Foundry Apps_.

This can be seen on the Dashboard:

More important for this memo is the _Resource list_ (in the icon:bars[] menu):

These are the items to create:

* _Cloud Foundry Apps_: develop the _My-Node-Red-App_, a {rNR-1} _flow_-based javascript application
without writing a single line of code.
* Cloud Foundry Services: create the _My-IoT-Platform_ service that acts as a MQTT broker, amongst other tasks.
In particular, configure MQTT communications between my devices and the database.
* Cloud Foundry Services: create the _My-Node-RED-App-cloudantNoSQLDB_ database,
more precisely an alias to the underlying database service. This alias is created automatically.
* Services: Bluemix creates _Cloudant-ay_ as the underlying database service where I store sensor readings.
The name is choosen by Bluemix during setup. Your name will be different.
* Services: Continuous Delivery: the toolchain service enabled for the app.
It includes a git repo and a delivery pipeline that deploys the app when pushed to the repo.
* Developer Tools: _My-Node-RED-App_ represents the actual toolchain associated with the app.

=== Dashboards

In addition to the initial Bluemix Dashboard ( which I found not useful for this memo), there is the IoT Platform dashboard and
the Cloudant database dashboard:

The IoT Platform Dashboard is used to create Device Types and Devices.

.The Cloudant Dashboard

The Cloudant Dashboard will contain sensor data.
The node-red database is created by Bluemix during setup.

=== Credential hell

One of the most intimidating aspects when using the cloud for the first time seems to be the avalanche
of credentials, passwords, access tokens, ids, and other access codes.

_Access code_ is a generic name I choose to refer to any kind of 'secret' that is required to use Bluemix and
the services it provides.
Here is a preview that should help to mitigate that onslaught.

WARNING: After creating an access code on Bluemix, it must be copied and saved immediately.
Some codes can't be retrieved at a later stage.
Also, these codes don't belong in the project's repository.

NOTE: In the following, I assume orgId = *nhr9i3*, your orgId will be different.

Create the Bluemix access code:

`Dashboard → Manage → Access IAM → IBM Cloud Api Keys -> Create an IBM Cloud API key`
