== Initialize the work flow

With `package.json` in place, finish the installation:

[listing]
$ npm install

=== Initialize the app

The first time the app is run, Node-RED will generate a credential file for `flow.json` named
`flow_cred.json`. This file contains sensitive data like the <<akat>>.
The NR-flow access code is used by Node-RED to decrypt this file.

Run the app from the project directory:

[listing]
$ ./run-app.sh

. enter the username provided in `settings.js` and the password supplied to the `node-red-admin hash-pw` command,
see <<NRp>>.
. open the IBM IoT node and enter the <<akat>>. Click on _Deploy_.
This will generate the credential file `flow_cred.json`.
. populate the repo, commit and push to Bluemix:

[listing]
$ git add -A && git commit
$ git push -u origin master

Open the Delivery Pipeline of the _My-Node-RED-App_ Toolchain dashboard:

While the build is running, log into the IBM Cloud CLI:

[listing]
----
$ ibmcloud login
API endpoint: https://cloud.ibm.com
Region: eu-gb <1>
Email> <enter the email address you used to register with Bluemix>
----
<1> it is very important to set the correct region. Check the domain you selected
when creating the cloud foundry app.

and set the endpoint:

[listing]
$ ibmcloud target --cf

After the build has finished, check the log from with IBM Cloud CLI:

[listing]
$ ibmcloud cf logs My-Node-RED-App --recent

Check the log carefully the first time the app is run.
The logs might not be available immediately after the build has finished,
this can take up to a minute.

Check the connection between the app and the database:

[listing]
$ ibmcloud cf services
name                              service           plan                bound apps        last operation
My-IoT-Platform                   iotf-service      iotf-service-free                     create succeeded
My-Node-RED-App-cloudantNoSQLDB   cloudantNoSQLDB   Lite                My-Node-RED-App   create succeeded

Remember that
_My-Node-RED-App-cloudantNoSQLDB_ is the service name provided to `manifest.yml`.
